      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        This project is created while considering the need of basic mathematical calculations that we use in our daily
        life such as arithmetic operations. To improve it's functionality, further I have implemented some extra 
        functions such logarithmic and trigonometric operations.

      <h3>Project Details</h3>
      <p>
        This project is created using basics of HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT, in which I have used
        "javaScript" to build logics that will help you to perform these operations. The best part of this 
        project is that you can do some extra operations like logarithmic and trigonometric accurately. It 
        supports BODMAS also.
