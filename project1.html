      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <h5>This project is still under development...ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€</h5>
      <p>
        This project is created while considering the need of every individual
        or an organisation to keep track of their expenses on daily basis ,
        weekly or yearly. You can fill the data of your expenses according to
        date and also by item-wise.

      <h3>Project Details</h3>
      <p>
        This project is created using "MERN Stack" , in which I have used
        "Reactjs" for frontend development and "Nodejs" for the backend
        development. The best part of this project is that you can perform the
        "CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete)" operation on your data. The another
        best functionality of this project(Expenses-Tracker) is that you can
        filter your data of expenses according to date, you have filled your
        data.
